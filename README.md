  <p>I'm a software engineer, based in Melbourne, Australia. </p>
  <p>
    I switched into tech after more than a decade in Mecahnical Engineering - I rediscovered my passion and living the dream now, building digital products and hoping to make the world a better place. ðŸ§€
  </p>
  <p>
  I am focused on back-end / full-stack and Machine Learning. I very much enjoy what I do.
